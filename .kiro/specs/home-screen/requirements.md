# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for the Home Screen system (gh3). The home screen is the main dashboard that displays after successful authentication, providing users with an overview of their GitHub profile and work items. The system follows Flutter's clean architecture patterns with modular component design.

## Requirements

4. WHEN the page content exceeds the screen height THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable content with a SliverAppBar
