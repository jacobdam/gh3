# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for the Home Screen system (gh3). The home screen is the main dashboard that displays after successful authentication, providing users with an overview of their GitHub profile and work items. The system follows Flutter's clean architecture patterns with modular component design.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen loads THEN the system SHALL display a "My work" section header
2. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Issues
3. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Pull requests
4. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Discussions
5. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Projects
6. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Repositories
7. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Organizations
8. WHEN the work section is shown THEN the system SHALL display placeholder cards for Starred
9. WHEN work item cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL render them with consistent styling patterns
10. WHEN work item cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide no navigation links or functionality (placeholder only)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the home screen to load quickly and perform smoothly, so that I can efficiently access my information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen is accessed THEN the system SHALL load within 2 seconds on typical mobile devices
2. WHEN the user scrolls through card lists THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the home screen to work well on different devices and be accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN colors are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain adequate color contrast ratios

### Requirement 6

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen is implemented THEN the system SHALL follow existing Flutter architecture patterns
