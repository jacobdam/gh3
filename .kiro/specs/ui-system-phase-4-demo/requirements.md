# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for Phase 4: Demo-Ready Application of the UI system improvement initiative (UIDRA). This phase delivers a polished, stakeholder-ready demonstration that showcases all UI system improvements, validates standards compliance, and provides a professional presentation of the complete GitHub mobile experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stakeholder reviewing the UI system, I want to see clear before-and-after comparisons of key improvements, so that I can understand the value and impact of the changes made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the demo application THEN it SHALL provide a dedicated section showing before-and-after comparisons for navigation improvements
2. WHEN viewing navigation comparisons THEN the demo SHALL clearly show the elimination of tab navigation in favor of action lists
3. WHEN reviewing scrolling app bar examples THEN the demo SHALL demonstrate the removal of duplicate titles with smooth transitions
4. WHEN examining spacing improvements THEN the demo SHALL show visual measurements confirming consistent 4dp grid implementation
5. WHEN viewing component comparisons THEN the demo SHALL highlight new state management components and card variants in action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a stakeholder evaluating the UI system, I want to see all components working together in realistic scenarios, so that I can assess the professional quality and consistency of the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating through example screens THEN all screens SHALL demonstrate proper component usage following established standards
2. WHEN viewing user flows THEN the navigation SHALL feel natural and intuitive with proper push navigation patterns
3. WHEN encountering loading states THEN they SHALL appear consistently across all screens using GHLoadingIndicator
4. WHEN viewing empty states THEN they SHALL provide helpful messaging and actionable next steps using GHEmptyState
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with clear messaging and retry options using GHErrorState

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stakeholder assessing the UI system quality, I want to see that all established standards are being followed, so that I can be confident in the system's maintainability and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any screen in the demo THEN it SHALL demonstrate compliance with all UI system standards
2. WHEN measuring spacing visually THEN all spacing SHALL follow the 4dp grid system without violations
3. WHEN examining components THEN there SHALL be no nested cards or other standards violations visible
4. WHEN testing interactions THEN all touch targets SHALL meet the 48dp minimum requirement
5. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN all components SHALL maintain proper contrast and accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a stakeholder preparing to approve the UI system, I want to experience smooth, professional interactions throughout the demo, so that I can be confident in presenting this to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the demo application THEN all animations and transitions SHALL be smooth without lag or jank
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN transitions SHALL complete within 300ms for optimal user experience
3. WHEN interacting with components THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and respond appropriately
4. WHEN encountering any issues THEN they SHALL be minor polish items rather than functional problems
5. WHEN overall assessment is made THEN the demo SHALL feel ready for production deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stakeholder conducting the final review, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand the system's capabilities and approve its implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing demo documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear explanations of all improvements and their benefits
2. WHEN reviewing component examples THEN each SHALL include usage guidelines and implementation patterns
3. WHEN examining the standards compliance THEN it SHALL be clearly documented with verification criteria
4. WHEN assessing the system's completeness THEN all requirements from previous phases SHALL be demonstrated as working
5. WHEN making the final approval decision THEN all necessary information SHALL be readily available and clearly presented

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer who will maintain this system, I want clear examples of proper implementation patterns, so that I can build new screens that follow the established standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining example screens THEN they SHALL serve as reference implementations for future development
2. WHEN reviewing component usage THEN it SHALL demonstrate best practices for each component type and variant
3. WHEN studying navigation patterns THEN they SHALL show correct implementation of push navigation and app bar behaviors
4. WHEN analyzing spacing implementation THEN it SHALL provide clear examples of the 4dp grid system in practice
5. WHEN using the system for new development THEN the examples SHALL provide sufficient guidance for maintaining consistency
