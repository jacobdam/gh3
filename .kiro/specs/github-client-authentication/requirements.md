# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for the GitHub Client Authentication system (gh3). The application is a Flutter-based GitHub client that implements OAuth device flow authentication to allow users to securely access GitHub repositories and user information. The system follows clean architecture principles with dependency injection and explicit dependency management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to authenticate with GitHub using the device flow, so that I can securely access my GitHub data without entering credentials directly on the mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a loading screen while checking for existing authentication
2. WHEN no valid authentication token exists THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen
3. WHEN the user initiates login THEN the system SHALL request a device code from GitHub with required scopes (repo, read:user)
4. WHEN a device code is obtained THEN the system SHALL display the user code and instructions to visit github.com/login/device
5. WHEN the user code is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a button to copy the code and open the GitHub device authorization page
6. WHEN the user authorizes the device THEN the system SHALL poll GitHub for the access token
7. WHEN an access token is received THEN the system SHALL store it securely and redirect to the home screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to persist across app sessions, so that I don't have to re-authenticate every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store the access token in secure local storage
2. WHEN the app is restarted THEN the system SHALL load the stored token and validate it
3. WHEN a stored token is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically log the user in
4. WHEN a stored token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL remove it and require re-authentication
5. WHEN validating a token THEN the system SHALL verify it has the required scopes (repo, read:user)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log out of the application, so that I can secure my account when using shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a logout option in the home screen
2. WHEN the user selects logout THEN the system SHALL clear the stored access token
3. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen
4. WHEN the user is logged out THEN the system SHALL prevent access to authenticated screens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of GitHub users I'm following, so that I can easily navigate to their profiles and repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated and on the home screen THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message
2. WHEN the home screen loads THEN the system SHALL show a list of sample GitHub users with their information
3. WHEN displaying user information THEN the system SHALL show username, display name, repository count, and follower count
4. WHEN a user taps on a user in the list THEN the system SHALL navigate to that user's detail screen
5. WHEN displaying users THEN the system SHALL show colored avatar placeholders with the first letter of the username

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about GitHub users, so that I can learn more about developers I follow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a user detail screen THEN the system SHALL display the username in the URL path
2. WHEN on a user detail screen THEN the system SHALL show placeholder content for user information
3. WHEN the user wants to go back THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to return to the previous screen

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about GitHub repositories, so that I can explore code and project details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a repository detail screen THEN the system SHALL display the owner/repo name in the URL path
2. WHEN on a repository detail screen THEN the system SHALL show repository information including URL, stars, forks, and issues
3. WHEN displaying repository details THEN the system SHALL provide a placeholder for README content
4. WHEN the user wants to go back THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to return to the previous screen

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow clean architecture principles, so that the code is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing services THEN the system SHALL register them with dependency injection using get_it and injectable
2. WHEN implementing ViewModels THEN the system SHALL create them manually with explicit dependencies
3. WHEN implementing screens THEN the system SHALL receive ViewModels through constructor parameters
4. WHEN routing between screens THEN the system SHALL use GoRouter with explicit dependency injection in route builders
5. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking of dependencies without complex DI setup

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for authentication flows, so that users receive appropriate feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub returns authorization_pending THEN the system SHALL continue polling after a 5-second delay
2. WHEN GitHub returns slow_down THEN the system SHALL wait 10 seconds before the next poll
3. WHEN GitHub returns access_denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN non-recoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the error details to the user
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide user feedback
