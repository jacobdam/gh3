# Requirements Document - GitHub GraphQL with Ferry

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for integrating Ferry and ferry_builder to connect to GitHub's GraphQL API in the gh3 Flutter application. Ferry is a GraphQL client that provides code generation, caching, and reactive data fetching capabilities. This integration will enhance the existing REST API implementation with more efficient data fetching and better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use GitHub's GraphQL API through Ferry, so that I can fetch exactly the data I need with fewer API calls and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Ferry SHALL be configured with GitHub's GraphQL endpoint
2. WHEN making GraphQL requests THEN Ferry SHALL automatically include authentication headers
3. WHEN GraphQL operations are defined THEN Ferry SHALL generate type-safe Dart code
4. WHEN GraphQL responses are received THEN Ferry SHALL provide strongly-typed data models
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN Ferry SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define GraphQL operations in .graphql files, so that I can leverage IDE support and maintain clean separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL operations are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in .graphql files
2. WHEN .graphql files are created THEN ferry_builder SHALL generate corresponding Dart code
3. WHEN GraphQL schema changes THEN the build process SHALL regenerate affected code
4. WHEN operations reference fragments THEN ferry_builder SHALL handle dependencies correctly
5. WHEN build runs THEN generated code SHALL be type-safe and include proper imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ferry to integrate with the existing architecture, so that GraphQL operations follow established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ferry is integrated THEN Ferry client SHALL be registered with Injectable for dependency injection
2. WHEN ViewModels need GraphQL data THEN they SHALL receive Ferry client through constructor injection
3. WHEN GraphQL operations are used THEN they SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as REST APIs
4. WHEN authentication tokens change THEN Ferry client SHALL update its headers automatically
5. WHEN screens use GraphQL THEN they SHALL maintain the screen-based modular architecture pattern

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for GraphQL operations, so that users receive appropriate feedback for different failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL errors occur THEN Ferry SHALL distinguish between network and GraphQL errors
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN Ferry SHALL provide specific error types
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN Ferry SHALL handle GitHub's rate limit headers
4. WHEN GraphQL responses contain errors THEN Ferry SHALL treat them as failures (no partial data handling)
5. WHEN offline scenarios occur THEN Ferry SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ferry operations to be testable, so that I can write comprehensive unit tests for GraphQL functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing GraphQL operations THEN Ferry SHALL support mocking responses
2. WHEN testing ViewModels THEN Ferry client SHALL be easily mockable
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN Ferry SHALL allow injection of error responses
4. WHEN testing caching THEN Ferry SHALL provide cache inspection capabilities
5. WHEN testing offline scenarios THEN Ferry SHALL support simulated network conditions
