# Requirements Document - GitHub GraphQL with Ferry

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for integrating Ferry and ferry_builder to connect to GitHub's GraphQL API in the gh3 Flutter application. Ferry is a GraphQL client that provides code generation, caching, and reactive data fetching capabilities. This integration will enhance the existing REST API implementation with more efficient data fetching and better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use GitHub's GraphQL API through Ferry, so that I can fetch exactly the data I need with fewer API calls and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Ferry SHALL be configured with GitHub's GraphQL endpoint
2. WHEN making GraphQL requests THEN Ferry SHALL automatically include authentication headers
3. WHEN GraphQL operations are defined THEN Ferry SHALL generate type-safe Dart code
4. WHEN GraphQL responses are received THEN Ferry SHALL provide strongly-typed data models
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN Ferry SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ferry to cache GraphQL responses, so that the app performs better and reduces unnecessary API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL queries are executed THEN Ferry SHALL cache responses in memory
2. WHEN the same query is requested again THEN Ferry SHALL return cached data if available
3. WHEN cached data becomes stale THEN Ferry SHALL provide mechanisms to refresh it
4. WHEN mutations are executed THEN Ferry SHALL update relevant cached queries
5. WHEN the app restarts THEN Ferry SHALL optionally persist cache to disk

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define GraphQL operations in .graphql files, so that I can leverage IDE support and maintain clean separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL operations are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in .graphql files
2. WHEN .graphql files are created THEN ferry_builder SHALL generate corresponding Dart code
3. WHEN GraphQL schema changes THEN the build process SHALL regenerate affected code
4. WHEN operations reference fragments THEN ferry_builder SHALL handle dependencies correctly
5. WHEN build runs THEN generated code SHALL be type-safe and include proper imports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see GitHub user profiles fetched via GraphQL, so that I can view comprehensive user information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a user profile THEN the app SHALL fetch user data using GraphQL
2. WHEN user data is requested THEN the query SHALL include profile fields, repositories, and followers
3. WHEN user data is displayed THEN it SHALL show avatar, bio, location, repositories, and statistics
4. WHEN user data is loading THEN the app SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN user data fails to load THEN the app SHALL display meaningful error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see GitHub repositories fetched via GraphQL, so that I can browse repository information with better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing repositories THEN the app SHALL fetch repository data using GraphQL
2. WHEN repository data is requested THEN the query SHALL include metadata, statistics, and README
3. WHEN repository lists are displayed THEN they SHALL support pagination through GraphQL cursors
4. WHEN repository details are shown THEN they SHALL include stars, forks, issues, and languages
5. WHEN repository README is displayed THEN it SHALL be fetched and rendered as markdown

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ferry to integrate with the existing architecture, so that GraphQL and REST APIs can coexist during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ferry is integrated THEN it SHALL work alongside existing REST API services
2. WHEN dependency injection is used THEN Ferry client SHALL be registered with get_it
3. WHEN ViewModels need GraphQL data THEN they SHALL receive Ferry client through injection
4. WHEN GraphQL operations are used THEN they SHALL follow the same error handling patterns
5. WHEN authentication tokens change THEN Ferry client SHALL update its headers automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for GraphQL operations, so that users receive appropriate feedback for different failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL errors occur THEN Ferry SHALL distinguish between network and GraphQL errors
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN Ferry SHALL provide specific error types
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN Ferry SHALL handle GitHub's rate limit headers
4. WHEN partial data is returned THEN Ferry SHALL provide both data and errors
5. WHEN offline scenarios occur THEN Ferry SHALL provide cached data when available

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ferry operations to be testable, so that I can write comprehensive unit tests for GraphQL functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing GraphQL operations THEN Ferry SHALL support mocking responses
2. WHEN testing ViewModels THEN Ferry client SHALL be easily mockable
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN Ferry SHALL allow injection of error responses
4. WHEN testing caching THEN Ferry SHALL provide cache inspection capabilities
5. WHEN testing offline scenarios THEN Ferry SHALL support simulated network conditions
