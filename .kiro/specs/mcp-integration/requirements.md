# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration system (gh3-mcp). The MCP integration enhances agent development by providing AI assistants with direct access to Flutter development tools, screenshot capabilities, and GitHub-specific automation. The system uses a service-oriented architecture integrated with the existing Injectable DI framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI assistants to capture screenshots of my Flutter app, so that I can get visual feedback and debugging assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger a screenshot through MCP THEN the system SHALL capture the current Flutter widget tree as a PNG image
2. WHEN a screenshot is captured THEN the system SHALL optimize the image size using PNG compression
3. WHEN multiple screenshots are taken THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old screenshots to prevent storage bloat
4. WHEN a screenshot fails THEN the system SHALL return an error message with details about the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI assistants to inspect my app's UI state, so that I can get detailed information about screen dimensions, widget hierarchy, and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request view details through MCP THEN the system SHALL return screen width, height, and device pixel ratio
2. WHEN I request view details THEN the system SHALL include logical dimensions and platform brightness
3. WHEN I request widget tree information THEN the system SHALL provide current route and widget count information
4. WHEN performance metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL include memory usage and rendering performance data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI assistants to integrate with my GitHub workflow, so that I can automate repository analysis and user profile operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request repository analysis THEN the system SHALL provide structure, activity, and statistics based on the analysis type
2. WHEN I request user profile information THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing AuthService for authentication state
3. WHEN I navigate through MCP THEN the system SHALL generate proper route paths compatible with GoRouter
4. WHEN GitHub operations are performed THEN the system SHALL leverage existing GraphQL infrastructure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI assistants to automate development workflow tasks, so that I can streamline build analysis, testing, and code quality checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request build analysis THEN the system SHALL analyze dependencies, build time, and package sizes
2. WHEN I run automated tests THEN the system SHALL execute test suites and provide coverage reports
3. WHEN I check code quality THEN the system SHALL analyze lint issues, code smells, and maintainability metrics
4. WHEN I monitor performance THEN the system SHALL track memory, CPU, rendering, and network metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP services to integrate seamlessly with my existing DI system, so that I can maintain consistent architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP services are initialized THEN they SHALL be registered with Injectable annotations
2. WHEN MCP services depend on other services THEN they SHALL use constructor injection
3. WHEN the app starts THEN MCP services SHALL initialize automatically through the existing DI configuration
4. WHEN MCP initialization fails THEN the app SHALL continue running without MCP features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a debug overlay for MCP functionality, so that I can test and monitor MCP operations during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the debug overlay is enabled THEN it SHALL display a floating action button to toggle the debug panel
2. WHEN the debug panel is open THEN it SHALL provide buttons for screenshot, view details, hot reload, and error checking
3. WHEN MCP actions are performed THEN the debug panel SHALL display the last action and result
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the debug panel SHALL show error details in a formatted display

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP tools to handle errors gracefully, so that failures don't crash the application or interrupt the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP operations fail THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with timestamps
2. WHEN network connections to MCP servers fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating without MCP features
3. WHEN service initialization fails THEN error messages SHALL be logged for debugging
4. WHEN MCP tools encounter exceptions THEN they SHALL wrap errors in standardized response format
