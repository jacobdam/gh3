## Introduction

The User Details Screen feature provides a comprehensive view of GitHub user profiles, displaying essential user information, statistics, and navigation to related content. This screen serves as the primary interface for exploring user profiles, accessible via URL routing with the pattern `/:login` where login is the GitHub username.

7. WHEN user data is available THEN the system SHALL display follower count and following count with proper formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate to different sections of a user's profile, so that I can explore their repositories, starred content, and organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen displays THEN the system SHALL show a "Repositories" list tile with the user's repository count
2. WHEN the user taps the "Repositories" list tile THEN the system SHALL navigate to the user's repositories view

4. WHEN the user taps the "Starred" list tile THEN the system SHALL navigate to the user's starred repositories view
5. WHEN the screen displays THEN the system SHALL show an "Organizations" list tile with the user's organization count
6. WHEN the user taps the "Organizations" list tile THEN the system SHALL navigate to the user's organizations view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the screen to handle loading and error states gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when data is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen is loading user data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN the user does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a "User not found" error message
3. WHEN there is a network error THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with retry option
4. WHEN user data fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a way to retry the request
5. WHEN the user has no bio, company, or location THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide those sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the screen to be responsive and performant, so that I can quickly access user information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen loads THEN the system SHALL fetch user data efficiently using GraphQL
2. WHEN displaying counts THEN the system SHALL format large numbers appropriately (e.g., 1.2k, 1.5M)
3. WHEN the user avatar loads THEN the system SHALL display it with appropriate caching
