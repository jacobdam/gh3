2. WHEN implementing number formatting THEN the system SHALL provide compact number formatting (1.2k stars, 45.2k forks) in `lib/src/ui-system/utils/number_formatter.dart`
3. WHEN implementing color utilities THEN the system SHALL provide programming language colors (JavaScript: yellow, Dart: blue, Python: blue, Swift: orange, etc.) in `lib/src/ui-system/utils/color_utils.dart`
4. WHEN accessing utilities THEN they SHALL be available through static methods with clear naming conventions
5. WHEN using color utilities THEN they SHALL support 10+ programming languages with appropriate fallback colors

### Requirement 4: Design Tokens Showcase Screen

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a design tokens showcase screen, so that I can visualize and validate all design tokens including colors, typography, spacing, and theme switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the design tokens screen THEN it SHALL be located in `lib/src/ui-system/examples/design_tokens_screen.dart`
2. WHEN displaying colors THEN it SHALL show a color palette grid with primary, secondary, surface colors and their hex values
3. WHEN showing typography THEN it SHALL display specimens of all 8 text styles with sample content demonstrating hierarchy
4. WHEN demonstrating spacing THEN it SHALL show spacing examples with visual measurements for all spacing tokens (4dp-32dp)
5. WHEN testing theme switching THEN it SHALL provide interactive light/dark theme toggle functionality
6. WHEN showing semantic colors THEN it SHALL display GitHub semantic colors (success, error, merged, draft) with usage context
7. WHEN displaying programming language colors THEN it SHALL show color swatches for 10+ languages with their names

### Requirement 5: Component Catalog Showcase Screen

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive component catalog screen, so that I can see all core UI components in different states and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the component catalog THEN it SHALL be located in `lib/src/ui-system/examples/component_catalog_screen.dart`
2. WHEN displaying components THEN it SHALL show all 7 core components (GHCard, GHButton, GHChip, GHListTile, GHSearchBar, GHStatusBadge, GHTextField) in working states
3. WHEN demonstrating states THEN it SHALL show components in enabled, disabled, and loading states where applicable
4. WHEN showing interactions THEN it SHALL provide interactive examples with tap feedback and visual responses
5. WHEN displaying variants THEN it SHALL show size variants and configuration options for each component
6. WHEN testing accessibility THEN it SHALL demonstrate that all touch targets meet 48dp minimum requirements

### Requirement 6: File Structure and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized file structure for the UI system, so that I can easily find and maintain design system components.

6. WHEN accessing example screens THEN they SHALL be in `lib/src/ui-system/examples/` directory

### Requirement 7: Fake Data Integration
