- [ ] 7. Build component catalog showcase screen
  - Create `ComponentCatalogScreen` in `lib/src/ui-system/examples/component_catalog_screen.dart`
  - Display all 7 core components in working interactive states
  - Show components in enabled, disabled, and loading states where applicable
  - Provide interactive examples with tap feedback and visual responses
  - Demonstrate size variants and configuration options for each component
  - Use realistic fake data including GitHub-appropriate button labels and status examples
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7_

- [ ] 8. Create UAT-specific entry point and navigation
  - Create `main_ui_system_uat.dart` as dedicated UAT entry point
  - Implement `DesignSystemUATApp` with proper theme configuration and routing
  - Create `UATHomeScreen` with navigation to showcase screens and theme switching
  - Ensure cross-platform compatibility for both web and mobile platforms
  - Test build commands for different platforms using the UAT entry point
  - _Requirements: Cross-platform UAT support from design document_

- [ ] 9. Integrate realistic fake data throughout showcase screens
  - Create fake data models for repositories, users, and other GitHub entities
  - Implement `FakeDataProvider` with realistic GitHub data (popular repositories, user profiles)
  - Include appropriate button labels ("Star", "Watch", "Fork", "Follow", etc.)
  - Add realistic status examples ("Open", "Closed", "Merged", "Draft", etc.)
  - Ensure programming language examples cover 10+ languages with proper colors
  - Include various date and number formatting examples
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive testing suite
  - Write unit tests for all utility functions (DateFormatter, NumberFormatter, ColorUtils)
  - Create widget tests for all 7 core UI components testing different states and interactions
  - Write widget tests for both showcase screens verifying proper rendering and functionality
  - Create integration tests for theme switching and cross-component interactions
  - Ensure all tests pass and provide good coverage of the design system functionality
  - _Requirements: Testing strategy from design document_

- [ ] 11. Update steering documentation for UAT approach
  - Update project steering documentation to reflect the decision to use `main_ui_system_uat.dart` for design system UAT
  - Document the rationale for cross-platform UAT support (web and mobile)
  - Include build commands and deployment instructions for stakeholder review
