# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for Phase 3: Complete Component Library of the UI system improvement initiative (UICCL). This phase implements all missing components referenced in the UI system standards, providing comprehensive state management components, card variants, and layout templates to complete the design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user encountering empty states in the application, I want clear and helpful messaging with actionable next steps, so that I understand why content is missing and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a screen with no content THEN the system SHALL display a GHEmptyState component with appropriate icon, title, and subtitle
2. WHEN the empty state has a resolution action THEN it SHALL display a properly styled action button using GHButton
3. WHEN viewing empty repository lists THEN the empty state SHALL show relevant messaging like "No repositories found" with search suggestions
4. WHEN viewing empty activity feeds THEN the empty state SHALL show encouraging messaging like "Your activity will appear here"
5. WHEN interacting with empty state action buttons THEN they SHALL provide immediate feedback and navigate to appropriate resolution screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user encountering errors in the application, I want clear error messaging with retry options, so that I can understand what went wrong and attempt to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL display a GHErrorState component with error title and descriptive message
2. WHEN an error is recoverable THEN the error state SHALL provide a "Retry" button that attempts the failed operation again
3. WHEN retrying an operation THEN the button SHALL show loading state during the retry attempt
4. WHEN errors occur during data loading THEN the error message SHALL be specific and helpful (e.g., "Unable to load repositories" not "Error 500")
5. WHEN viewing error states THEN they SHALL follow the same design tokens and styling as other components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing different types of content, I want cards with appropriate padding for the content type, so that information is presented clearly without wasting space or feeling cramped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using GHCard.compact() THEN it SHALL provide 12dp padding on all sides for secondary content and lists
2. WHEN using GHCard.tight() THEN it SHALL provide 8dp padding on all sides for dense content and minimal layouts
3. WHEN using GHCard.zeroPadding() THEN it SHALL provide no padding for content that manages its own spacing like ListTile
4. WHEN comparing card variants THEN the padding differences SHALL be visually distinct and appropriate for their use cases
5. WHEN using any card variant THEN the styling, elevation, and corner radius SHALL remain consistent with the standard GHCard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing content-heavy screens, I want organized sections with proper metadata display, so that I can easily navigate and understand complex information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using GHContentTemplate THEN it SHALL organize content into clearly defined sections with appropriate spacing
2. WHEN displaying section titles THEN they SHALL use consistent typography and spacing from design tokens
3. WHEN showing metadata THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and positioned for easy scanning
4. WHEN viewing multiple sections THEN they SHALL be separated by appropriate spacing (20dp) to create clear visual hierarchy
5. WHEN content template is used THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with GHScreenTemplate and maintain consistent page margins

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing loading states, I want consistent and informative loading indicators, so that I understand the system is working and what is being loaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL display GHLoadingIndicator with consistent spinner styling
2. WHEN loading takes longer than expected THEN the indicator SHALL include an optional descriptive message like "Loading repositories..."
3. WHEN loading indicators appear THEN they SHALL be properly centered and sized for their context
4. WHEN multiple loading states exist THEN they SHALL all use the same GHLoadingIndicator component for consistency
5. WHEN loading completes THEN the indicator SHALL be replaced smoothly with the loaded content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the component library, I want all new components to be properly showcased and documented, so that I can understand their capabilities and implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the component catalog screen THEN all new components (GHEmptyState, GHErrorState, card variants, GHContentTemplate) SHALL be visible and interactive
2. WHEN interacting with component examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate proper usage patterns and different configurations
3. WHEN viewing component documentation THEN each component SHALL have clear usage examples with code snippets
4. WHEN testing components THEN they SHALL work correctly in both light and dark themes
5. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL follow all design token standards and accessibility requirements
