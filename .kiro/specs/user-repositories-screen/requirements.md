## Introduction

The User Repositories Screen provides a comprehensive interface for users to browse, search, and filter their GitHub repositories. This screen serves as a central hub for repository management, allowing users to quickly find specific repositories through various search and filtering options while displaying repository information in an organized, scannable format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to view all my repositories in a list format, so that I can quickly browse through my projects and access them easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the repositories screen THEN the system SHALL display a list of all user repositories
2. WHEN repositories are loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. WHEN no repositories exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN a repository is tapped THEN the system SHALL navigate to the repository details screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to search through my repositories by name, so that I can quickly find specific projects without scrolling through the entire list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters text in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter repositories by name in real-time
2. WHEN the search field is empty THEN the system SHALL display all repositories
3. WHEN search results are empty THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message
4. WHEN the user clears the search field THEN the system SHALL restore the full repository list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to filter my repositories by type (all, private, source, fork, mirror, template, archived), so that I can focus on specific categories of repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a repository type filter THEN the system SHALL display only repositories matching that type
2. WHEN "Show all" is selected THEN the system SHALL display repositories of all types
3. WHEN a type filter is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the filter state during the session
4. WHEN multiple filters could apply THEN the system SHALL combine filters using AND logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to filter my repositories by programming language, so that I can find projects written in specific technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a language filter THEN the system SHALL display only repositories using that primary language
2. WHEN no language is selected THEN the system SHALL display repositories regardless of language
3. WHEN a repository has no primary language THEN the system SHALL include it in "No Language" filter option
4. WHEN language filter is applied THEN the system SHALL show the count of repositories for each language

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to sort my repositories by various criteria (recently pushed, least recently pushed, newest, oldest, name ascending, name descending, most starred, least starred), so that I can organize them according to my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a sort option THEN the system SHALL reorder repositories according to that criteria
2. WHEN "recently pushed" is selected THEN the system SHALL sort by last push date in descending order
3. WHEN "name ascending" is selected THEN the system SHALL sort alphabetically by repository name A-Z
4. WHEN "most starred" is selected THEN the system SHALL sort by star count in descending order
5. WHEN sort is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the sort order during the session

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want to see essential repository information in each list item, so that I can quickly assess repositories without opening them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the repository list THEN each repository card SHALL display the repository name
2. WHEN a repository has a description THEN the system SHALL display the description text
3. WHEN a repository has a primary language THEN the system SHALL display the language with appropriate color coding
4. WHEN a repository has stars THEN the system SHALL display the star count
5. WHEN a repository was recently updated THEN the system SHALL display the last updated timestamp
6. WHEN a repository is private THEN the system SHALL display a private indicator icon

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want the screen to have a clear title and navigation, so that I understand where I am in the app and can navigate back easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repositories screen loads THEN the system SHALL display "Repositories" as the screen title
2. WHEN the user wants to go back THEN the system SHALL provide a back navigation button
3. WHEN the screen is part of a tab navigation THEN the system SHALL highlight the repositories tab as active
4. WHEN the user pulls down on the list THEN the system SHALL refresh the repository data
5. WHEN the screen is accessed via URL THEN the system SHALL use the pattern `/:login/@repositories` for routing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a GitHub user, I want the search and filter controls to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly modify my view without scrolling or complex navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repositories screen loads THEN the search field SHALL be prominently displayed at the top
2. WHEN the user wants to access filters THEN filter controls SHALL be easily discoverable near the search field
3. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of applied filters
4. WHEN the user wants to clear all filters THEN the system SHALL provide a clear/reset option
