# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for Phase 2: Spacing Standardization of the UI system improvement initiative (UISS). This phase implements consistent 4dp grid spacing across all screens, eliminates spacing inconsistencies, and fixes activity card padding issues, directly addressing user feedback item #6.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the home screen, I want consistent visual spacing between all sections and items, so that the interface looks professional and well-organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the home screen THEN there SHALL be exactly 20dp spacing between major sections (user card, quick actions, activity feed, trending)
2. WHEN viewing activity items THEN there SHALL be exactly 8dp spacing between individual activity cards as they are related content
3. WHEN viewing repository cards in trending section THEN there SHALL be exactly 12dp spacing between individual repository cards
4. WHEN viewing activity cards THEN they SHALL use zero padding with ListTile to prevent double padding appearance
5. WHEN measuring spacing visually THEN all spacing SHALL follow the 4dp grid system (8dp, 12dp, 16dp, 20dp, 24dp, 32dp)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating between different screens, I want consistent page margins and content spacing, so that the app feels cohesive and professionally designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any screen in the application THEN the horizontal page padding SHALL be exactly 16dp on both left and right sides
2. WHEN viewing content within any screen THEN major section breaks SHALL use exactly 20dp vertical spacing
3. WHEN viewing lists of items THEN unrelated items SHALL be separated by exactly 12dp vertical spacing
4. WHEN viewing grouped or related items THEN they SHALL be separated by exactly 8dp vertical spacing
5. WHEN measuring with browser developer tools THEN all measurements SHALL confirm adherence to the 4dp grid system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing various card-based content, I want appropriate padding that makes content readable without feeling cramped or wasteful of space, so that I can easily consume information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing standard content cards THEN they SHALL use 16dp padding on all sides for rich content like user profiles and repository details
2. WHEN viewing compact content cards THEN they SHALL use 12dp padding on all sides for list items and secondary content
3. WHEN viewing activity cards with ListTile content THEN the cards SHALL use zero padding to prevent double padding with ListTile's built-in padding
4. WHEN viewing any card content THEN text and interactive elements SHALL be appropriately spaced for readability
5. WHEN comparing different card types THEN the padding differences SHALL be visually distinct and purposeful

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user examining the visual design, I want all spacing to follow a consistent mathematical system, so that the interface feels harmonious and intentionally designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring any spacing in the application THEN it SHALL be a multiple of 4dp (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32)
2. WHEN viewing section headers THEN they SHALL have 12dp spacing below them before content begins
3. WHEN viewing content sections THEN they SHALL have appropriate spacing above and below based on their relationship (8dp for related, 12dp for unrelated, 20dp for major sections)
4. WHEN viewing the entire application THEN no spacing SHALL violate the 4dp grid system
5. WHEN using browser measurement tools THEN all spacing measurements SHALL be exactly as specified without approximation
