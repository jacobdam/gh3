# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document captures the requirements for Phase 1: Navigation Compliance of the UI system improvement initiative. This phase eliminates tab navigation in favor of action-based push navigation and implements Material Design scrolling app bars to remove duplicate titles, directly addressing user feedback items #3 and #4.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing a user profile, I want to see actionable navigation options instead of tabs, so that I can navigate to dedicated screens using push navigation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any user profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a list of actionable items instead of tab navigation
2. WHEN tapping "Repositories" action THEN the system SHALL push to a dedicated repositories screen showing the user's repositories
3. WHEN tapping "Starred" action THEN the system SHALL push to a dedicated starred repositories screen
4. WHEN tapping "Organizations" action THEN the system SHALL push to a dedicated organizations screen
5. WHEN viewing action items THEN each SHALL display a count badge and chevron indicator
6. WHEN navigating from any pushed screen THEN the back button SHALL return to the user profile screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing user details, I want to see the title information only once on screen, so that I don't have redundant information displayed in both the app bar and content area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initially viewing user details screen THEN the system SHALL display the user's name in the content area with minimal or no app bar title
2. WHEN scrolling down on user details screen THEN the user's name SHALL smoothly transition from content area to app bar title
3. WHEN scrolling back up THEN the app bar title SHALL fade out and the content area title SHALL become visible
4. WHEN at any scroll position THEN only one instance of the user's name SHALL be visible on screen
5. WHEN transition animations occur THEN they SHALL follow Material Design guidelines for smooth, professional appearance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating through the application, I want all navigation to use push patterns consistently, so that I can always navigate back through my navigation history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating from user profile actions THEN the system SHALL use push navigation for all destination screens
2. WHEN viewing any pushed screen THEN the system SHALL display a back button in the app bar
3. WHEN tapping the back button THEN the system SHALL return to the previous screen in the navigation stack
4. WHEN on the home screen THEN no back button SHALL be displayed as it is the root screen
5. WHEN deep in navigation stack THEN users SHALL be able to navigate back through their complete history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the improved navigation system, I want smooth and intuitive interactions, so that the app feels professional and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping action items THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback before navigation
2. WHEN screen transitions occur THEN they SHALL complete within 300ms for optimal user experience
3. WHEN scrolling triggers app bar transitions THEN the animations SHALL be smooth without jank or stuttering
4. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback to the user
5. WHEN using the application THEN all interactive elements SHALL meet 48dp minimum touch target requirements
