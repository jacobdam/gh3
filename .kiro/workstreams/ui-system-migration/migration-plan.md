# UI System Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for migrating existing gh3 screens to the new UI system components.

## Migration Principles

1. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one screen at a time to minimize risk
2. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
3. **Design Token Adoption**: Replace hardcoded values with design tokens
4. **Component Reuse**: Use UI system components instead of custom implementations
5. **Testing Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage during migration

## Existing Screens to Migrate

### Priority 1 - Core Screens
- [ ] Login Screen (`login_screen.dart`)
- [ ] Home Screen (`home_screen.dart`)
- [ ] User Details Screen (`user_details_screen.dart`)
- [ ] User Repositories Screen (`user_repositories_screen.dart`)

### Priority 2 - Navigation & Supporting Screens
- [ ] Loading Screen (`loading_screen.dart`)
- [ ] User Organizations Screen (`user_organizations_screen.dart`)
- [ ] User Starred Screen (`user_starred_screen.dart`)

### Priority 3 - App Shell
- [ ] Main App (`gh3_app.dart`)
- [ ] Navigation/Routing System

## Migration Steps per Screen

### 1. Analysis Phase
- [ ] Document current screen functionality
- [ ] Identify custom components that can be replaced
- [ ] List hardcoded values to replace with tokens
- [ ] Note GraphQL queries and data requirements

### 2. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Replace imports with UI system components
- [ ] Update styling to use design tokens
- [ ] Replace custom widgets with UI system equivalents
- [ ] Implement proper loading/error/empty states
- [ ] Update to use layout templates where applicable

### 3. Testing Phase
- [ ] Update existing unit tests
- [ ] Add widget tests for new UI components
- [ ] Perform visual regression testing
- [ ] Test theme switching (light/dark)
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance

### 4. Review Phase
- [ ] Code review for consistency
- [ ] UI/UX review against design system
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Final approval before merge

## Component Mapping Guide

| Current Implementation | UI System Replacement |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Custom cards | `GHCard` |
| Custom buttons | `GHButton` |
| Custom list items | `GHListTile` |
| Repository displays | `GHRepositoryCard` |
| User displays | `GHUserCard` |
| Status indicators | `GHStatusBadge` |
| Loading spinners | `GHLoadingIndicator` |
| Empty states | `GHEmptyState` |
| Search inputs | `GHSearchBar` |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All screens use design tokens (no hardcoded colors/spacing)
- [ ] Consistent visual appearance across all screens
- [ ] Improved accessibility (48dp touch targets)
- [ ] Maintained or improved performance
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Theme switching works correctly
- [ ] No regression in functionality

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: Core screens migration (1 week)
- **Phase 2**: Supporting screens (3 days)
- **Phase 3**: App shell and final integration (2 days)
- **Buffer**: Testing and refinement (3 days)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 2.5 weeks

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, feature flags for gradual rollout

2. **Risk**: Performance degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing at each step, optimize as needed

3. **Risk**: Visual inconsistencies
   - **Mitigation**: Regular UI reviews, strict adherence to design tokens

## Next Steps

1. Get approval on migration plan
2. Start with Login Screen as proof of concept
3. Gather feedback and adjust approach
4. Proceed with remaining screens
