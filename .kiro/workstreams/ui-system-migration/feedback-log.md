# UI System Feedback Log

## Purpose

This document tracks all feedback received on the UI system implementation and the actions taken to address each item.

## Feedback Format

Each feedback entry should include:
- **Date**: When feedback was received
- **Category**: Component/Screen/Theme/Navigation/Performance/Other
- **Feedback**: Detailed description of the feedback
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Status**: Open/In Progress/Resolved/Deferred
- **Resolution**: Actions taken to address the feedback

## Feedback Entries

### 2025-01-28 - Initial Review Pending

**Category**: General  
**Feedback**: Awaiting initial human review of the UI system implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Resolution**: Pending human review of example screens

### 2025-01-28 - Navigation Pattern Update

**Category**: Navigation  
**Feedback**: The navigation should be push navigation. At the start screen, users will see the home screen with no back button. When opening any link, it should use push navigation.  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Resolution**: âœ… Implemented push navigation pattern:
1. Updated NavigationService to use `router.push()` instead of `router.go()` for all navigation methods
2. Home screen already configured with `showBackButton: false` 
3. Added helper methods `navigateBack()` and `canNavigateBack()` for navigation management
4. Created navigation pattern documentation in `navigation-pattern.md`

### 2025-01-28 - User Details Page Navigation Pattern

**Category**: Navigation  
**Feedback**: On the user details page, I don't like tab navigation. It should be a list of actions, each action should push a new screen.  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Resolution**: Pending implementation. Need to:
1. Remove tab navigation from user details/profile page
2. Replace with a list of action items (Repositories, Starred, Organizations, etc.)
3. Each action should push to a dedicated screen instead of switching tabs
4. Maintains consistency with push navigation pattern

### 2025-01-28 - User Details Screen Scrolling App Bar

**Category**: Screen/Theme  
**Feedback**: On the user details screen, the title appears in both the app bar and the body card. When scrolling, the title in the content should transition to become the app bar title, following Material Design patterns.  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Resolution**: Pending implementation. Need to:
1. Implement Material Design's collapsing app bar pattern (SliverAppBar)
2. Initially show empty/minimal app bar title
3. As user scrolls and the body title goes off-screen, fade in the app bar title
4. Use smooth transition animation between states
5. Follow Material Design guidelines for large title transitions

### 2025-01-28 - Home Screen Nested Card Issue

**Category**: Component  
**Feedback**: On home screen, the current user card is in another card (nested cards).  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Resolution**: âœ… Fixed by removing the outer GHCard wrapper. The GHUserCard component already includes a card in its implementation, so wrapping it in another GHCard created unnecessary nesting.

---

### 2025-01-28 - Spacing Consistency Issues

**Category**: Theme  
**Feedback**: Spacing is inconsistent. Page padding are different between pages. Card padding is too much for activity card. Spacing between cards on screen must follow a good principle and be consistent.  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Resolution**: Pending implementation. Need to:
1. Standardize page padding across all screens (recommend 16dp horizontal)
2. Review and adjust card padding - activity cards need less padding (8-12dp instead of 16dp)
3. Define consistent spacing between cards (recommend 8dp or 12dp consistently)
4. Create spacing guidelines document
5. Apply Material Design spacing principles (4dp grid system)
6. Ensure all screens follow the same spacing system
